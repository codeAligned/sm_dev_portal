0.2.24 - adding (hardcoded) css foat:none to "cancel" button span (x)  because BS team have added float:rigth to it (why?) in one of newest BS versions; this was the reason that sometimes badge's "x" button moved to new line separately.
0.2.23 - support bsMultiSelect on dropdown: click to remove/unselect the item is now processed in setTimout(..,0) this helps filter out close clicks in dropdown's hide event handler (investigate that clicks target was bsMultiSelect and ignore it)
